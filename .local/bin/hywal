# Small script to switch to a wallpaper using swaybg or swww and update pywal colors.
# Used by the rofi "frontend" accessible with SUPER+W.

# INFO : both swaybg and swww are supported in this script, so swap at will by commenting/uncommenting anything related to either.
# I prefer to use swaybg since I don't care about animated wallpapers and swww takes a lot of system resources.

# In case the wallpaper is a symlink, since ~/.config/hypr/scripts/current_wal is one
wallpaper=$(realpath "$1")
